# reasytries

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The pyeasytries package contains classes and functions that efficiently store and search words passed by the user based on a trie data structure.

This package was developed as a project for UBC MDS-Vancouver program DSCI 524 course.

## Installation

You can install the released version of reasytries from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("reasytries")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/reasytries")
```
## Overview
Storing and searching words can be expensive in terms of time and computing: for example, using a balanced binary search tree, the time complexity for searching a word is $O(mlogn)$, where $m$ is the length of the word and $n$ is the number of keys in the tree. However, with the trie data structure, the time complexity for searching can be reduced to $O(m)$. The `reasytries` package is a simple tool to aid word insertion, deletion, and searching in the trie data structure. Users can pass any words to be stored for later-on searching or printing with certain prefix, and even modify the words in storage.

## Features (TO BE MODIFIED BY Mitchie)

- `Class TrieNode`: creates a trie node.
- `Class Trie`: initializes a trie data structure with or without adding any words.

Within `Class Trie`:

- `contain(self, word)` function takes in a word and searches through the trie structure to check if it has been stored in the trie already.

- `find_prefix(self, prefix)` function takes in a prefix string and searches through the trie structure and returns a list of all words stored with the given prefix.

- `add(self, word_to_add)` function takes in a word and stores each letter of the new word in the trie data structure.

- `delete(self, word_to_delete)` function takes in a word and deletes the letters of the word if they are contained in the trie already.

## R Ecosystem (TO BE MODIFIED BY Jordan)
This `pyeasytries` package aims to simplify and speed up the process of searching through a fixed dictionary. In addition to time complexity benefits, a tries data structure also allows to search for given words inside the fixed dictionary when given a prefix. Users who are building a search/filter bar from a fixed dictionary will find this package useful! As trie is a famous data structure, there are currently some similar packages in Python such as  [pygtrie](https://pypi.org/project/pygtrie/).
